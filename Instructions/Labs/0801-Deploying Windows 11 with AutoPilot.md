# Practice Lab: Deploying Windows 11 with Autopilot

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how provision a Windows 11 device with Autopilot using User-driven mode.

### Prerequisites

To following lab(s) must be completed before this lab:

- 0101-Managing Identities in Azure AD

- 0102-Synchronizing Identities by using Azure AD Connect

- 0701-Deploying Windows 11 using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit


### Scenario

Contoso IT is planning to roll out a deployment of new Windows 11 devices using Autopilot. The devices have a default installation of Windows 11. Users should be able to connect the device, turn it on, and answer minimal questions during the OOBE, using their Azure AD credentials to sign in. The process should automatically enroll and join the Azure AD domain. You have been asked to configure and test the experience using the SEA-WS4, which you recently installed and configured using Hyper-V.

### Task 1: Create group in Azure AD

1. Sign in to **SEA-SVR1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd** and close **Server Manager**.

2. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

3. In Microsoft Edge, in the address bar, type **https://aad.portal.azure.com**, and then press **Enter**. If prompted, sign in with your **`Admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`** and the default tenant password.

4. In the navigation pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.

5. Under **Manage**, select **Groups**.

6. In the **Groups | All groups** blade, select **New group**.

7. In the **New Group** blade, in the **Group type** list, select **Security**.

8. In the **Group name** box, type **IT Devices**.

9. In the **Group description** box, type **IT Department Devices**.

10. In the **Membership type** list, select **Dynamic Device**.

11. Select **Add dynamic query**.

12. On the **Dynamic membership rules** blade select **Edit** above the **Rule syntax** box.

13. In the Edit rule syntax text box, add the following simple membership rule and select **OK**.

```
(device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -contains "[ZTDId]"))

```
14. Select **Save** to close **Dynamic membership rules**, and then select **Create** to create the group.

### Task 2: Generate a device-specific comma-separated value (CSV) file

1. Switch to **SEA-SVR2** and sign in as **Contoso\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Select **Hyper-V Manager** in the taskbar.

7. At the Windows PowerShell command-line prompt, type the following cmdlet, and then press **Enter**:

```
Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo
```

8. You will receive three prompts. Each time, type **Y**, and then press **Enter**.

9. At the Windows PowerShell command-line prompt, type the following cmdlet, and then press **Enter**:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

10. When prompted, type **Y**, and then press Enter.

11. At the Windows PowerShell command-line prompt, type the following cmdlet, and then press **Enter**:

```
Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -OutputFile C:\Computer.csv
```

12. At the Windows PowerShell command-line prompt, type the following command, press **Enter**, and then review the file content:

```
type C:\Computer.csv
```

13. At the Windows PowerShell command-line prompt, type the following command, press **Enter**. This will copy the file to SEA-SVR2:

```
copy c:\computer.csv \\sea-svr2\labfiles
```

14. Close the Windows PowerShell command prompt.

### Task 3: Work with a Windows Autopilot deployment profile

1. Switch to **SEA-SVR1**.

3. In the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**, select **Devices**.

4. In the **Device enrollment** section, select **Enroll devices**. 

5. In the details pane scroll down to **Windows Autopilot Deployment Program**, and then select **Devices**.

6. In the **Windows Autopilot devices** blade on the menu bar, select **Import**, select the **folder icon** and then browse to **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Labfiles**, select **Computer.csv**, select **Open**, and then select **Import**. 

   _Note: The import process can take up to 15 minutes, but normally takes around 5 minutes._  

   _**Important**: After the process is complete, the device may not show. If this is the case, select the **Sync** button, wait a few minutes, and then select **Refresh**._

7. Select **X** to close the **Windows Autopilot devices** blade.

4. Select **Remove everything**, and then select **Local reinstall**.

5. Select **Next** and then select **Reset**.

   _Note: Normally this task is not required for new deployment of physical devices. The deviceâ€™s autopilot info is either provided by the manufacturer or can be obtained from the device prior to the OOBE. For the purposes of this lab, we must initiate a reset to simulate a new device OOBE._

   _Note: This process can take 30-45 minutes and will reboot several times during the process. Your instructor may continue with the next module while this task completes. Be sure to come back to complete Task 5 during your next lab session._
