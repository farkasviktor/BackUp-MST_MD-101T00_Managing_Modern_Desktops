# Error Log - MD-101: Managing Modern Desktops 

The log is for awareness of known issues with labs.

### 09-10-21 
Lab 0303 - Configure Enterprise Roaming and Edge Sync

Some MCTs have reported issues with ESR taking longer than usual.  While the current steps have been recently tested as is, some MCTs have reported inconsistent results, and recommended additionally assigning the Windows 10 license and/or creating a new user.
The move taskbar step has been removed. While this step should work, it has not reliably worked in the lab environment. 

We are continuing to review this lab and working to identify revisions to the steps to help improve the performance and consistency.
